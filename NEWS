* Version 1.1.0.5; November 4, 2014

  - Bug fix: Failed conversion items did not get their temporary directories
    removed.
  - Better error handling in processing of conversion items if an
    image's dimensions cannot be determined.

* Version 1.1.0.4; October 29, 2014

  - Performance improvement: When the number of OCR items per scan reaches a
    certain limit, non-OCR conversions are paused to allow the number of OCR
    items to fall to a reasonable level before being resumed again. For large
    scans with OCR enabled, this is necessary because so many OCR items are
    extracted from PDFs or Office documents that it exhausts the number of
    available inodes on the filesystem.
  - Connnection pooling is removed due to database problems.

* Version 1.1.0.3, October 10, 2014

New in this version:

 - Bug fix: Catch InternalError exception in process_manager.py.
 - Conversion queue items of a given type are now picked randomly from among
   the active scans to avoid one scan hogging the queue.

* Version 1.1.0.2, October 10, 2014

New in this version:

 - Bug fix: CPR check using wrong digit to validate birth date. The CPR rule
   was using the 8th digit instead of the 7th digit of the CPR number to
   validate the birth date of CPR numbers.
 - Periodically delete conversion queue items from finished scans that may
   not have been properly cleaned up when they finished.
 - Ignore and delete images extracted from converted files if their are
   dimensions do not meet minimum dimensions: both width and height must be
   >= 7 pixels and at least one dimension must be >= 64 pixels.
 - Scans are logged to separate files in var/logs/scans rather than
   polluting the web server's error log file.
 - Pool PostgreSQL connections to avoid too heavy load on the database server.
 - System status page for superusers.

* Version 1.1.0, September 23, 2014

New in this version:

 - Better parsing of names to avoid false positives.
 - Linkchecker functionality included.
 - Modulus-11 tweaking.
 - A huge number of minor GUI fixes.
 - Web service for scanning URLs or documents from other programs etc.
 - Set proper permissions for scan data. 
 - Use Last-Modified check to disregard previous scans.
 - Allow scanning of subdomains.
 - Disk usage/disk performance improvements.
 - 10 seconds timeout on PDF files in the link checker.
