* Version 1.1.0.2, October 10, 2014

New in this version:

 - Bug fix: CPR check using wrong digit to validate birth date. The CPR rule
   was using the 8th digit instead of the 7th digit of the CPR number to
   validate the birth date of CPR numbers.
 - Periodically delete conversion queue items from finished scans that may
   not have been properly cleaned up when they finished.
 - Ignore and delete images extracted from converted files if their are
   dimensions do not meet minimum dimensions: both width and height must be
   >= 7 pixels and at least one dimension must be >= 64 pixels.
 - Scans are logged to separate files in var/logs/scans rather than
   polluting the web server's error log file.
 - Pool PostgreSQL connections to avoid too heavy load on the database server.
 - System status page for superusers.
