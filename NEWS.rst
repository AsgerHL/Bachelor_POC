OS2datascanner
==============

Version 3.3.1, 14th May 2020
----------------------------

"You've Got Mail"

Neither the user interface of version 3 of OS2datascanner nor its underlying
scanner engine would have become as advanced as they are without the efforts of
Steffen JÃ¸rgensen and of Dan V. P. Christiansen. The OS2datascanner development
team thanks them for their many contributions.

New in this version:

- Support for handling matches:

  - The report module now has a button for setting the resolution status of a
    match.

  - Resolved matches are hidden from the user interface, but are preserved in
    the database for later reference.

- Support for email notifications:

  - The report module now has a command that sends email notifications of
    unhandled matches to all users.

General improvements:

- All of the unused code in the administration system that was once responsible
  for interacting with the old scanner engine has been removed.

- The appearance of the administration system's user interface elements is now
  changed when they receive focus.

- Many modal dialog boxes have been removed from the administration system,
  giving a more contemporary feel.

Bugfixes:

- The components of the scanner engine's pipeline no longer opportunistically
  prefetch messages, improving error resilience and scalability.

- Scanning Exchange Web Services accounts should no longer produce occasional
  character decoding errors.

- Errors in the metadata extraction process no longer cause all of the relevant
  file's metadata to be discarded.

- Errors in external tools are now handled uniformly.

  unsuccessfully processed.

- A new report module:
