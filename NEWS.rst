Version 3.0-alpha1, TBD
--------------------

New in this version:

    - We've renamed the application and project to OS2 datascanner
      internally.
    - This release breaks compatibility with the 2.x series,
      necessitating a new install.
    - Domains and Scanners no longer exist as separate concepts,
      having been combined into one.
