HOWTO get the system up and running for development
===================================================

This document explains how to get the source code, set up the database, run the
tests and boot the development server.  Get the code

git clone platon.magenta-aps.dk:/home/git/os2webscanner

Install Django and Scrapy, including system dependencies

cd os2webscanner/django-webscanner/
./install.sh

Note: The installation will try to install all needed system packages not
present on a fresh install of Ubuntu. This part of the installer uses apt-get
install and has only been tested with Ubuntu.

Once install.sh has succeeded, do

Set up the database
===================

If you performed the previous step, you've already installed postgresql and
postgresql-client.

Assuming this done:

sudo su - postgres
createdb os2webscanner
createuser os2webscanner
psql


The following commands must be executed IN psql shell.

grant all on database os2webscanner to os2webscanner;
alter user os2webscanner with password 'os2webscanner'; 
alter user os2webscanner createdb;

If you choose another password, please change in settings.py. The last "alter
user" is to enable the test suite to run on PostgreSQL.

Now log out from psql and the postgres user to proceed, returning to where you
cloned the os2webscanner source dir.  

Test and initialize
===================

source ../python-env/bin/activate
python manage.py test

The test should pass. Now do

python manage.py syncdb

and create a user with a password you can remember.

Start the system with

python manage.py runserver 8080

and access the admin system at

http://localhost:8080/admin/


Start the scanning processors
=============================

You need to start the process manager background process in order to get actual
scans done.

cd /home/os2/os2webscanner
source python-env/bin/activate  # If not active already
python scrapy-webscanner/process_manager.py &


That's it!
