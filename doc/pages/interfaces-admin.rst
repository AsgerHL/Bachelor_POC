Logging in to the administration interface
------------------------------------------

The administration interface can be found at
``http://<your admin domain>:8020``.

Creating an organisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface has been designed to support several customers at once, so many
types of object must have an *organisation* associated with them. There is no
default organisation, so create one by logging in to the Django administration
site at ``http://<your admin domain>:8020/admin/`` with the new superuser account and
then selecting the *Add* option under *OS2datascanner â†’ Organizations*.
