# Datascanner frontend architecture


## Applications

Presently, Datascanner's main web GUIs are the **admin** and **report**
modules. The source code for both resides in
[src/os2datascanner/projects](./src/os2datascanner/projects).


## HTML markup

Markup is mostly generated using [Django
templates.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/templates/)


## Shared static resources

The static resources are located in
[src/os2datascanner/projects/static](./src/os2datascanner/projects/static). Django is configured to look in this path (actually on the corresponding `dist` path in the Docker container) when it collects static resources. This allows both apps to use the same set of static resources without
having to maintain duplicate copies.

## Webpack setup

Static resources are bundled up via
Webpack and output in a `dist` subfolder to `src/os2datascanner/projects/static`; consult
[src/os2datascanner/projects/static/webpack.base.js](./src/os2datascanner/projects/static/webpack.base.js)
for the configuration. Note that since the JS code isn't really modularized,
most of what Webpack does is statically copy over the folders `js`&dagger;, `3rdparty`, `admin`, `css`, `favicons`, `fonts`, `recurrence` and `svg` with `CopyWebpackPlugin`. &dagger; The exception to the JS files is the file `index.js` which serves as the Webpack entry point. Finally, the `scss` folder is also not copied over, as its contents need to be transpiled into CSS first. This is achieved by importing `master.scss` into `index.js` and then using `sass-loader` for Webpack to handle that import statement.

For hot reloading to work, we define the CMD `["npm", "run", "dev", "--prefix", "static"]`
in `/docker/admin/Dockerfile` (and `/docker/report/Dockerfile`). This CMD is defined
in the `frontend` stage of those Dockerfiles and will boot up a webpack dev server
that listens for changes to the static frontend files. We stop at that stage in
development when using the `frontend` service; consult `/docker-compose.yml`.
This means that we can then mount in the static files from the host into the
`frontend` container, and the webpack dev server will refresh when we edit the
files on the host. Since the `dist` folder that webpack outputs its files to is
shared with the `admin` and `report` services (our two Django apps), changes
to the static files will automatically be picked up by Django.

For all this to work, however, we need to explicitly define
`/code/src/os2datascanner/projects/static/node_modules/` as volumes in the `frontend`
service. If we don't, mounting in the static directory from the host into the
container will lead to errors, if the directory of the host doesn't contain a
`node_modules` folder (which it won't, unless you happened to run `npm install`
on the host). The caveat to this is that if you install new dependencies with
`npm` on the host (which will make them appear in the host's `node_modules` folder),
they won't automatically appear in the container's `node_modules`. You need to
rebuild the `frontend` and boot up the container again.
`docker-compose up --build -d frontend` should do the trick.

## CSS styling

An effort has been made to establish SASS as the guiding workflow for CSS builds
but it is mixed with other approaches.
Amongst others:

* CSS built from SASS and bundled up via Webpack (via plugins)
* CSS imported directly or from 3rd parties

## JavaScript

A minimal set of JS is bundled as described in "Shared static resources" above. Other scripts are just added via script tags in the Django templates.

Admin app also includes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) Javascript but
without the accompanying bootstrap.css

* **Package management**
  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). At the time of writing, NPM packages are exclusively used for the bundling setup (you'll only see `devDependencies` in `package.json`, no `dependencies`). JS code imports no modules.
* **Old browser support**
  Babel is currently neither installed nor configured. IE support is achieved via conditional comments in `<head>`.


## Fonts

Admin and Report app use the "Inter" font.


## Icons

There are several icon styles and frameworks in use:

* [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) is self-hostedâ€”see [src/os2datascanner/projects/static/fonts/materialicons](src/os2datascanner/projects/static/fonts/materialicons) and the accompanying CSS file.
* Admin app has [Glyphicons](https://www.glyphicons.com/sets/halflings/).
  These are most likely a leftover from the webscanner incarnation of the project. They may still be in use, however.
* Both Report and Admin apps hide a set of SVG icon files in their respective
  `templates/components/svg-icons/` folders.
* A small set of SVG icon files are available in the shared static files in `src/os2datascanner/projects/static/svg`


## Build & package management

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used for building frontend assets.

# TODOS for a simpler frontend architecture

Decisions to make:

* IE11-support by Babel/bundling vs. IE11 by old school coding (no bundling)?
* JS bundling vs decentralised JS (see above)?

One hybrid approach includes both bundling and decentralized code:

1. Decide on what is core JS/CSS. Bundle only that.
   Embed it on every page (base|index.html).
   Adding eventlisteners to certain elements is probably not core.
2. Load component-specific JS/CSS from their specific templates.
   Use script/styling/extra_head blocks.
   Most eventlisteners go here.
3. Put component-specific JS/CSS/SCSS with related templates (if possible)
4. Decide on what icon system to use. Use only that.
